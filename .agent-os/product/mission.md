# CivilDIY Microservices Framework - Mission & Vision

## Mission

Provide a scalable, production-ready microservices architecture template that demonstrates modern distributed system patterns including event-driven architecture, service discovery, API gateway routing, and CQRS with materialized views for high-performance reads.

## Vision

Enable developers to experiment with and understand microservices architecture principles through a practical, fully-functional framework that can be deployed locally or in containerized environments (Docker Compose, Dockge LXC, etc.).

## Project Status

**Current Phase:** Experimental/Testing Phase
- Used for learning and validating microservices patterns
- Deployed locally on Docker Desktop/Docker Compose
- Testing deployment on Dockge LXC container environments
- Not yet production-ready (security and performance optimizations pending)

## Target Users

- **Software Architects:** Learning and validating microservices design patterns
- **Backend Developers:** Understanding event-driven architecture and service orchestration
- **DevOps Engineers:** Exploring containerization and service discovery patterns
- **Development Teams:** Establishing baseline for microservices implementations

## Key Use Cases

1. **Learning Platform:** Understanding how microservices interact and communicate
2. **Architecture Validation:** Testing CQRS pattern and event-driven design
3. **Deployment Testing:** Validating frameworks work across different deployment environments
4. **Architecture Reference:** Providing a template for new microservices projects

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All services run correctly locally via Docker Compose
- [ ] Services integrate properly on Dockge LXC environment
- [ ] Event propagation through Kafka works reliably
- [ ] API Gateway routes and validates all requests correctly
- [ ] Service discovery and health checks function as expected
- [ ] Documentation is clear and accurate for learners
- [ ] Automated testing suite covers core workflows
